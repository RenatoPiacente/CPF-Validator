# CPF Validator 

## Create a program that takes an informed CPF (Brazilian SSN) and an algorithm that validates its last two digits.


e.g.

0 -> 1 * 10 = 10           #    1 * 11 = 11 <-
1 -> 6 * 9  = 54           #    6 * 10 = 60
2 -> 8 * 8  = 64           #    8 * 9  = 72
3 -> 9 * 7  = 63           #    9 * 8  = 72
4 -> 9 * 6  = 54           #    9 * 7  = 63
5 -> 5 * 5  = 25           #    5 * 6  = 30
6 -> 3 * 4  = 12           #    3 * 5  = 15
7 -> 5 * 3  = 15           #    5 * 4  = 20
8 -> 0 * 2  = 0            #    0 * 3  = 0
                           # -> 0 * 2  = 0
